# Behavioural design patterns

Behavioural design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
 In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way 
 that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
# Strategy pattern

The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a Behavioural 
software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
## What problem is solved by the Strategy pattern in Java?
The Strategy pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, 
encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable.
