# Behavioural design patterns

Behavioural design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
 In these design patterns, the interaction between the objects should be in such a way 
 that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
# Observer pattern

Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is also referred to as the publish-subscribe pattern.
